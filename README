I wrote this tool to help a friend adapt an HDR tool ('Photomatrix')
to making time-lapse sequences.  It's entirely general, so it may be
adaptable to other situations as well.


From the usage message:

This is a basic command-line tool for producing new xml files based in start and end files.
Usage: interpolate_xml.py start.xml end.xml top_step current_step

Compute step [current_step] of 0 to [top_step] steps between a given start and
end xml file, replacing any numeric values with interpolated values.  Outputs
a new xml file on standard out.

Options:
  --version   show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit

If current_step is 0, the values from start.xml are used; if current_step is
top_step, the values from end.xml are used.  Thus there are top_step + 1 total
steps (including step 0.)  If integer values occur in start.xml (they don't
have a decimal point) then the interpolated value will be rounded to the
nearest integer.
